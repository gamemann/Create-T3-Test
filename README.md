# Test Create T3 Application
A repository to help with learning [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) which is being used in a future version of [Best Mods](https://github.com/bestmods).

Create T3 App is a CLI built by seasoned T3 Stack devs to streamline the setup of a modular T3 Stack app. This means each piece is optional, and the "template" is generated based on your specific needs.
